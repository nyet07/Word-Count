Project Details:

Client-Server Architecture with named pipes(FIFOs). POSIX FIFOs are used to enable communication between 
separate processes. Double-fork technique is used within the server process to 
avoid zombie processes when dealing with client requests. 

Client makes a request to the server, and server forks a process using double fork
technique to deal with that specific client. Simultaneous client requests are allowed.
