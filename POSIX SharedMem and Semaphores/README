Project Details:

Exactly the same project as project 3, except that POSIX shared memory and semaphores are used in this one. 
Instead of FIFOs, POSIX shared memory and POSIX semaphores are used in this project.
Shared Memory is faster compared to FIFO, since it doesn't require a call to the kernel.
Weakness of shared memory is that programmer himself has to solve problems because of
synchranization issues.
